### Resampling

Based on the resampling analysis, the Naive Random Oversampling and SMOTE Oversampling sampling methodologies provide the best balanced accuracy score of  0.993.  The Naive Random Oversampling and SMOTE Oversampling sampling methodologies provide the best recall score of 0.99 based on high-risk debtors.  The Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, and Undersampling Cluster Centroids sampling methodologies provide the best geometric score of 0.99.     

### Ensemble Learning

Based on the ensemble learning analysis, the Balanced Random Forest Classifier ensemble methodology provides the best balanced accuracy score of  0.995 and the best recall score of 1.00.  Surprisingly, the Easy Ensemble Classifier ensemble methodology provides the best geometric score of 0.73, compared to the Balanced Random Forest Classifier ensemble methodology having a higher harmonic mean (F1-score) of 0.99.  The top three features of the Balanced Random Forest Classifier are the total debt interest received of (0.069), total payment invoiced of (0.066), and the last payment amount (0.063).
